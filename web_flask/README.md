# What is a web framework?

Web development or web application frameworks refer to a set of resources and tools available to software and web developers. These frameworks give web developers the ability to build and manage web applications, web services and websites.

## What exactly is a web framework?

It is a software framework that was developed in order to simplify the web development process and make it easier to build a  [website](http://evolvedesign.ie/q-and-a/design-development/what-are-the-common-pitfalls-of-website-design-and-how-can-you-avoid-them/). It includes templating capabilities that allow you to present information within a browser, provides an environment for scripting how information flows and also contains many application programming interfaces (APIs) for gaining access to underlying  [data resources](http://evolvedesign.ie/q-and-a/business-strategy/what-is-the-advantage-of-big-data-analytics/). Most frameworks also provide tools in order for web developers to build a content management system (CMS) for managing digital information on websites and the Internet.

A web application or development framework can be considered as a pre-built structure that handles the more repetitive processes and features involved with developing a website. This means that a web developer will spend most of their time interacting with the different parts of the web framework through the use of code.

Some of the features associated with web frameworks include web caching, authentication and authorisation procedures, database mapping and configuration and URL mapping.

## The advantages and disadvantages of web frameworks

The most notable advantages for web developers that use a web framework are due to the fact that it is open source, efficient, has a good level of support, has a high level of security and includes an integration feature.

Being open source means that web frameworks are very cost effective for both the developer and the client. This doesn’t mean that they aren’t of good quality. Most of the popular web frameworks used by developers are free for use. Efficiency is another important advantage for web developers. This is because web frameworks eliminate the need to write a lot of repetitive code allowing developers to build websites and applications much quicker. A web framework also comes with a support team and advanced security features meaning that you can be rest assured knowing that if an issue does arise, it will be handled by a team of experts. One of the most helpful features of a web framework is its integration feature that has the ability to allow developers link other tools such as databases to the framework.

However, saying that, developers often note that the biggest disadvantages with using a web framework are due to it being very limited in terms of making changes to the web framework. Everything from coding paradigms and design is very restrictive. This could cause frustration for web developers. Another disadvantage is that some developers find it difficult to learn the language behind web frameworks. Oftentimes, web developers will learn the framework but will not know the coding language behind it making it difficult for them to fully understand everything about the web framework itself.

For many developers, ultimately whether they use a web framework or not is down to their own personal coding preferences. However, for those that choose the web framework route they find that generally the advantages of the resource outweighs the disadvantages.
